        <h1> Metal Working</h1>
        <p> Metal working is about imagination creativity and technique. Metal working is very time consuming but it always depends on what your project is how big and how complicated it is. you can make a a small simple project that would take a day or two
            or you can do a really complicated project that will take a week or more. You will always have to saw your metal. once you saw all the pieces you need to sauder them together to make your design between each process you will need to file and
            sand. Even though metal working is tedious work it is still fun to do and the out come of your design is always the best part.</p>

        <ol> Steps to sawing metal

            <li> draw your design on a piece of graph paper</li>

            <li>cut out your desgin</li>

            <li>get your metal</li>

            <li> add rubber cement (NOT TOO MUCH) to the back of the paper with your design and onto your metal</li>

            <li> wait till the rubber cement dries</li>

            <li>once the rubber cement dries on both your metal and paper, put the paper on top of the rubber cement that is on the metal and make sure that its flat down and secure</li>

            <li>when you're done with the previous step get a saw frame and a saw</li>

            <li> before putting the saw in the saw frame make sure that the teeth are face down</li>
